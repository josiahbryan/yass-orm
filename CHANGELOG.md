## [2.0.5] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed

- Fixed type generator singularization for English words ending in `-es` (e.g., `chat_inboxes` now correctly generates `ChatInboxInstance` instead of `ChatInboxeInstance`)

### Added

- Added `singularize()` helper function in `lib/generate-types.js` that properly handles English pluralization rules:
  - Words ending in `-xes`, `-sses`, `-ches`, `-shes`, `-zes` → drop `-es`
  - Words ending in `-ies` → change to `-y`
  - Default → drop `-s`
- Added test coverage for singularization in `test/generate-types.test.js`
- Exported `singularize` function from module

## [2.0.4] - Previous
